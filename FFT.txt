in a fairly simple design of a music database such as itunes, there would be

artists(info{name, etc..})
albums(name, number of songs, id#,price,release date)
songs(runtime, name,other useful info,genere,popularity)

and then there would be the following relationship
(artist,album,song)


some redundancy can be seen in the relationship, per haps redundancy could be shave off by making two smaller relationships?
