6.1

(sigma)  is the select operation used in the following format
(sigma)_<selection condition> (relation)

returns all tuples meetingthe conditions
conditions can involve comparisons such as =, < , > , != and can make use of AND and OR operators.

(Pi) operator returns all of the specified columns of a given relation

used in the following format:

(Pi)_<attribute list> (relation)

the corresponds to the select command of sql, but only returns distinct values, and cannot show duplicates.

renaming can be done through direct assignment
goo(<new list of attribute names (optional)>) <- (sqigma)_dno=5 (EMPLOYEE)

or through (rho) operator used in one of three ways:
(rho)_(b1,b2,b3,...)(relation) or (rho)_S (relation) on (rho)_(b1,b2,b3,...) (relation)


6.2

relational algebras can also accept union intersect and minus operators from set theory, which are pretty intuitive.

(relation1) union (relation2) returns all tuples from either relation1 or relation2
(relation1) intersect (relation2) returns all tuples in both relation 1 and relation2
and relation1 minus relation2 returns all tuples in relation1 but not in relation2

cross product or cross join
simply creates a new relation withh all attributes from the two relations being crossed

ie...   R(a1,a2,a3,..)X S(b1,b2,b3,...)= !(a1,a2,a3,...,b1,b2,b3,...)

6.3

join operation signfied with a bowtie symbol is used liek a cross product on relations that are unionable, and then a sigma operation is perfromed on that product

ie
relation1(a1,a2,a3,...) (join)_a1=b1 relation2(b1,b2,b3,...)

joins can be done on the =, < , > , ! and similar comparison operators.

an equijoin is specifically only using the = comparison and a natural join is an equijoin between two relations where the two relations share an attribute name

now we see that the set of relational algebra operations {(sigma), (Pi), union, (rho), -, X} can be called complete because any operation can be expressed as a composite of the other operations.

division operator is not part of this set but is a part of relational algebras.

the division operator finds all of the values that are members of tuples that also contain the specified values in other attributes.

a query tree is a graphical (tree) representation of a nested relational algebra operation.
